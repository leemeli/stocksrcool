# Stocks R Us

##Project Description
> Our project will simulate buying stocks and viewing stock fluctuations with imaginary money to provide educational value and experience without risking loss of real money,
> while also being able to view stock information related to recent political events.
> This can benefit many individuals who are trying to learn about the industry, from the college business student to people with personal political stakes.
> We will be utilizing React to load information from the Quandl Finance API based on the user’s stock portfolio, Firebase to store information of the user’s stock portfolio, and CSS libraries such as Bootstrap and Chart.js to give our site a more responsive, user-friendly style.
> With these technologies, we have developed a web application that will match our goals of providing an intuitive process of learning about trading stocks.

##How to use the site
> The user is required to be signed up and logged in in order to use the site.

> Signing up is as simple as filling out the required fields correctly then signing up!

> If you already have an account you can just login with your email and password, the signup and login are both on the same page.

> Once you login, you are taken to the homepage which will display a stock graph, list of stocks and their political affiliations.

> You are given $5000 to start which is displayed in the navigation bar. You can buy or sell stocks based on whether you have enough money or the required stocks to sell!

> You'll see that the stocks here are labelled with political affiliations - Democrat, Republican or Unknown. Use these to help make an informed decision on whether or not you want to invest in a company!

> Clicking "My Portfolio" will show your gains and losses for certain stocks as well as some other useful stock information!

> Clicking "My Timeline" will, after loading from an API, show every stock that the user has purchased on a graph constructed by Chart.js! You're able to choose a timeframe to see how those stocks have changed over time.

> The "Settings" tab allows the user the freedom to change their name.

> In addition to changing their name, the user here is able to file for bankruptcy - which resets their account - certainly very useful if you end up running out of money entirely but want to use the same account.

> And when the user's done shopping for stocks, they can sign out with the "Sign Out" button.

> Then a week later, they can come back and see how much they've gained - or lost!

> Note: Since this site is reliant on a free API from Quandl, those API requests may take a long time.
