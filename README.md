# Stocks R Us

##Project Description
> Our project will simulate buying stocks and viewing stock fluctuations with imaginary money to provide educational value and experience without risking loss of real money,
> while also being able to view stock information related to recent political events.
> This can benefit many individuals who are trying to learn about the industry, from the college business student to people with personal political stakes.
> We will be utilizing React to dynamically load information from the Quandl Finance API based on the user’s stock portfolio, Firebase to store information of the user’s stock portfolio, and a CSS library such as Bootstrap and Chart.js to give our site a more responsive, user-friendly style.
> With these technologies, we have developed a web application that will match our goals of providing an intuitive method of learning about trading stocks.

##How to use the site
> The user is required to be signed up and logged in in order to use the site.

> Signing up is as simple as filling out the required fields correctly then signing up!

> If you already have an account you can just login with your email and password, the signup and login are both on the same page.

> Once you're in, you are presented with a list of stocks and their political affiliations.

> You can buy or sell stocks based on whether you have enough money or the required stocks to sell! You'll lose or gain money in exchange for stocks - money is displayed on the left in green.

> You'll see that the stocks here are labelled with political affiliations - Democrat, Republican or Unknown. Use these to help make an informed decision if whether or not you want to invest in a company!

> Clicking "My Portfolio" will show your gains and losses for certain stocks!

> By default, there is no preference for political affiliation. Clicking the Democrat or Republican tab guarantees that any new searches will search for either Democrat or Republican companies.

> Clicking "My Timeline" will, after loading from an API, show every stock that the user has purchased on a graph constructed by Chart.js! You're able to choose a timeframe to see how those stocks have changed over time.

> Settings allows the user the freedom to change their name.

> In addition to changing their name, the user here is able to file for bankruptcy - which resets their account - certainly very useful if you end up running out of money entirely but want to use the same account.

> And when the user's done shopping for stocks, they can sign out with the "Sign Out" button.

> Then a week later, they can come back and see how much they've gained - or lost!

> Note that since this site is reliant on an API, those API requests may take a long time.
